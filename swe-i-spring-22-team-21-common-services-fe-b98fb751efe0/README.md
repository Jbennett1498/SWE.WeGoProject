# Common Services FE

## About / Synopsis

* This repository contains the front end developmental code for our common services. Our code creates a form for users to create an account that will connect with our CS-BE and will store their information in our CS mongoDB. The new user or returning user will then be able to interact with our login screen, to log in to their account and access their dashboard, from their the Demand FE/BE or the Supply FE/BE will take over. 
* Project status: In-progress
