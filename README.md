# SWE.WeGoProject
Worked with a creative team of 6, leveraging the agile scrum framework to
develop a platform featuring transportation services using autonomous vehicles. Starting with the framework, I drafted the design of the system using object oriented application design, user center design, and system design patterns. I also performed spikes and decisions evaluating map services, data design, SQL vs. NoSQL, skinny integration, and white & black box testing to understand the emerging customer business targets. My role was a full stack engineer where I designed, developed, unit tested, and maintained a multi-cloud solution with API integrations. The web application I developed consisted of a python backend, database (mongoDB), billing services, that communicated with our supply cloud through rest APIâ€™s, requesting autonomous vehicles (constant location, eta., vehicle description, etc.). Through this project, I created a vehicle simulator that was multithread and had vehicle maintenance service design documentation, fleet manager alerts, a security framework, and implemented a CI/CD pipeline.
